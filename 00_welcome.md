# 00_welcome

Let's begin the easiest level.

- Start by running the ls command, which allows you to list the files. After that, read the contents of the WELCOME.md file using the cat command (cat README.md).

- By reading the contents of the README.md file, you will get a clue that will help you find the different passwords.

- Then run the pwd command which will let you know which directory you are in.

- Exit to the directory you are in using the cd command followed by a space and then a colon (cd ..).

- Run this command twice in a row. Then, use the pwd command to find out which directory you are in.

- Then run the ls command to list the files and folders.

- Enter the level folder using the cd command (cd level).

- After running the previous command, list the existing files in the directory using the ls command.

- Then enter the 00_welcome folder using the cd command (cd 00_welcome).

- List all files in the 00_welcome folder using the ls command.

- There is a file named README.md in the 00_welcome directory. Read the contents of the README file using the cat command (cat README.md).

- The level 0 solution is very self-explanatory, as are all the other levels.
