# 04_kwisatz

- Let's start level 04. Exit the previous file as usual, and make sure that you are in the "level" folder again. Don't forget the usual command you've already used to get out of a folder.

- Enter the "04_kwisatz" folder using the command you already know. List the contents of this folder. Then read the file you are going to find which is called "READ.nfo". You will find information that will allow you to find the solution for the "04_kwisatz" level.

- It will tell you to look in your home directory (in linux, the tilde indicates a user's home directory).

- Exit the "level" directory with the command you already know. Then, use the "pwd" command to find out which one you are in. Next, list the contents of the folder you are in. You're going to find three folders, then enter the "user" folder, don't forget the command to do this. Next, enter the "user" directory. Then enter the folder that has your username (cd + username).

- Then perform the "ls" command to list the contents of that folder. You'll find five files and folders. Enter the "level" folder, then list its contents. Then enter the folder you are going to find. In this folder that you are about to find, list its contents. Normally, you'll find two files with two different extensions. Read the contents of each file using the "cat" command.

- You'll find the solution for this level in one of these two files.
