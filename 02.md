# Level 02

- To continue, make sure that you are in the "level" folder by using the "cd.." command. When you are in the "level" folder, list the files and folders in that folder again. Then enter the "02" folder. After that, list the contents of the "02" folder. But this time, use the "ls -a" command because in this folder "02" there are hidden files.

- You're going to find a hidden file called "solution". This file will not be visible if you use the usual ls command. By using the "ls -a" command, you will be able to list all files even if they are hidden.

- The dot in front of the file name means it's a hidden folder. To read the contents of this file, we will usually use the "cat" command followed by the file name. This time, you're going to use the command anyway but add a period in front of the filename because don't forget that the "solution" file is a hidden file (cat .solution).
