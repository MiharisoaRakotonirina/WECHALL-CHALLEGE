# Level 03

- Let's continue with level 03. You should be in the "level" folder using the usual command to exit the previous folder.

- Then enter the "03" folder. Start by listing all files even hidden files using the "ls -a" command.

- You'll find two files hidden in this folder.  Read the first hidden file and you will find the solution there using the cat command (cat .the file name).
